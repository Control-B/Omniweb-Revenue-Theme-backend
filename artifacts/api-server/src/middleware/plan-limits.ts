/**
 * Middleware enforcing active subscriptions and monthly message limits on
 * widget endpoints (/api/chat, /api/voice).
 *
 * Two independent gates — either can trigger a 402:
 *
 * 1. **Subscription gate** (paid plans only):
 *    If the merchant is on a paid plan (starter / pro) but their subscription
 *    status is NOT "active" or "trialing", return 402 immediately — even if
 *    they have 0 messages used this month.
 *
 * 2. **Usage gate** (all plans):
 *    If the merchant has consumed all messages in their effective monthly
 *    allowance (free plan = 50, starter = 500, pro = 5 000), return 402.
 *    The effective allowance is always the *free* tier when the subscription
 *    is inactive, so an inactive paid merchant gets both gates applied.
 *
 * The shopId is read from req.body.
 * If shopId is absent the request passes through (other middleware validates it).
